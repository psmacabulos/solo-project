This is a simple project created when I am applying for a scholarhip on Holberton School

This site describes my journey to web development, how I shifted and how I plan to continue.

I have used javascript to add minor interactions and animations. Also integrated some tweets following X's instructions.

Only used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I have used free services such as Twitter , facebook, youtube, and disqus to add socials on this site.
