                One of the reason I decided to shift into tech is I can simultaneously achieve my Mission üííü§ùüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è in

            <h2>App with an Impact</h2>
            <h3>No to Drugs</h3>
            <p>
                Yes your read it right. It is not a typo. How the heck does an app relate to drugs? Hmmnnn.. Good
                question! And I myself is still thinking
                how to implement it. But the goal is simple, If I can leverage the power of the internet and app
                building in decreasing if not eliminating
                people who abuse drugs, I'm a happy Man!
            </p>
            <p>
                Why drugs you say? I have seen how drugs ruin a family's life whether they are born poor or wealthy. Its
                a sad story, and I know I can make a
                difference by utilizing technology.. Maybe a Holberton Project??? Dont get ahead of yourself Pat, Go get
                the scholarship first! üòÖ
            </p>
            <h3>Yes to Life</h3>
            <p>
                Do you know that in Australia alone, there are 3, 249 deaths by suicide in 2022 ? This based on Suicide
                Prevention Australia. It only reflects that there are still alot to be done. People need help and I
                think we can by using technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                How about a social media app dedicated to those who are struggling in their life. People who can help
                others without being too affected or lets say have the emotional maturity can also register and provide
                FREE advice for those who are seeking help.
            </p>
            <p>
                "There is no need for this, there are hotline provided by most companies." I hear you, but some
                people prefer to vent their thoughts on social media and not all are vocal. I am still unsure how to
                implement this but this is an idea that I think I can create soon.
            </p>
