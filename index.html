        "Life begins at 40" At first, I thought this is just a passing quote by those who missed
        out on their younger years. But now that I am walking on this path, I found it insightful
        and now think 40 as a moment of rebirth, a chance to embark on new adventures and time to
        embrace one's forgotten <em>passion and potential</em>.

      <h2>Career Journey</h2>
      <h3>High School Teacher</h3>
      <p>
        Never in my wildest dream that my first job after college is becoming a high school
        Teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am only 19 at the time and the one I taught on my first year are 16 year olds! I still
        remember the very first time I enter the classroom and they taught I am a visitor üòÅ.
      </p>
      <h3>Manufaturing Roles</h3>
      <p>
        While it's both fun and rewarding being a Teacher but after 2 years, I have decided to
        move on and enter the world of Manufacturing. I started as a machine operator and later
        used my CAD skills to become a CADMAC technician. Sounds technical but all I do is draw
        the parts in a computer and program so that it is machined properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, I was involed in Production planning. But the job seems to be repetetive so I
        decided to go back to the tools and become a hydraulic technician in Moog Controls. This
        is my dream job. Since I love problem solving, I really enjoyed the task of
        troubleshooting a faulty equipment and applying my skills and knowledge to make it work
        again. That feeling of solving the task and the accomplishment I felt is so satisfying.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as for all things... I started looking for other adventures, and that is where I
        stumbled upon, you guess it, <strong>Web Development!</strong>
      </p>
      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <img
        src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/226232/pexels-photo-226232.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1"
        alt="chess set with hand showing a move">
      <p>I immediately realized the vast potential being a Software Developer.</p>
      <p>Using software, I can do the following:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul ">
        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-check-square"></i></span>Make an impact globally by creating an
          app that solves a real-world problem.</li>
        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-check-square"></i></span>Help Businesses improve their efficiency
          by automating repetitive tasks.</li>
        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-check-square"></i></span>
          Increase the presence of organizations I believe in by making a great website and make
          it known globally.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>And so, my Web development journey commenced...</p>
      <h3>Self Study</h3>
      <p>
        During the Pandemic, I started to fall in love on the idea to become a Web developer and
        dipped my foot on endless YouTube tutorials. It was confusing at first, but everytime I
        get something working, that feeling of creating a program to do something for you excites
        me and made me more convinced that this is my next career shift and probably the last one.
      </p>
      <h3 class="job-hunting">Job Hunting and the Reality</h3>

        alt="job hunting">
      <p>
        After thinking, I know enough, I started applying for any software / IT jobs I can find on
        Seek and LinkedIn and to my diappointment, I got zero job offer. Sure enough, the
        competition is fierce and my skills are still subpar compared to other entry level
        applicants.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in my quest to improve, I started looking for scholarships here in Victoria that can help
        me bridge that gap both in Technical and Personal Level, ... and that's how I found
